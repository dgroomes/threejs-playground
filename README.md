## Instructions

Follow these instructions to build and run the project.

1. Install dependencies:
   * `npm install`
1. Build the the project continuously and serve the web content:
   * `npm run start`
   * The browser will open automatically and show the final product!

## Design

This project uses three.js to make an animation inspired by pixel art.

The animation can be hosted in GitHub Pages. The process is not automated. Build the project with `npm run build`, then copy the contents of
`dist/` into `docs/` and then commit and push the changes. The final result should be published by GitHub to the
repository's GitHub Pages page at <https://dgroomes.github.io/threejs-playground>.
